Hi,Greeting,Hi! How can I assist you today?
Why is my period so heavy this month?,Menstrual Health,"A heavy period (menorrhagia) may be caused by hormonal imbalances, uterine fibroids, polyps, thyroid issues, bleeding disorders, or changes in birth control. Stress and perimenopause can also influence flow.

Home Remedies/Self-Care:
- Use a menstrual cup or period tracking app to monitor flow.
- Apply a heating pad to ease cramps.
- Eat iron-rich foods (e.g., spinach, red meat, legumes) to prevent anemia.


Disclaimer: This is a general first-aid response. If your period lasts more than 7 days, involves large clots, or interferes with daily life, consult a doctor."
What causes a missed period besides pregnancy?,Menstrual Health,"Missing a period can be due to stress, PCOS, excessive exercise, under/overweight, thyroid disorders, certain medications (like antidepressants), or early menopause.

Home Remedies/Self-Care:
- Balance nutrition and avoid extreme dieting.
- Practice stress-relief activities (e.g., yoga, breathing exercises).
- Maintain a consistent sleep and exercise routine.

Disclaimer: If you've missed two or more periods in a row (not due to pregnancy), it's best to seek a medical check-up."
Why do I have period cramps but no bleeding?,Menstrual Health,"This may be due to ovulation, implantation (if pregnant), uterine fibroids, endometriosis, or the onset of menstruation. It can also occur after stopping birth control.

Home Remedies/Self-Care:
- Use a warm compress on your abdomen.
- Drink herbal teas like ginger or chamomile for muscle relaxation.
- Gentle yoga or stretching can relieve cramps.

Disclaimer: Severe or recurring cramps without bleeding may signal an underlying condition. See a healthcare provider if symptoms persist."
Is it normal to have clots in my period blood?,Menstrual Health,"Small clots (less than a quarter in size) are normal, especially on heavy flow days. Large or frequent clots may indicate fibroids, endometriosis, or hormonal imbalances.

Home Remedies/Self-Care:
- Track clot size and flow duration using a journal or app.
- Use heat therapy and stay active to encourage healthy blood flow.
- Increase iron intake to prevent fatigue from blood loss.

Disclaimer: See a healthcare provider if you consistently pass large clots or feel fatigued or dizzy."
Why do I feel dizzy during my period?,Menstrual Symptoms,"Hormonal shifts, blood loss, low iron levels (anemia), or low blood sugar can lead to dizziness. Prostaglandins (chemicals causing cramps) may also lower blood pressure.

Home Remedies/Self-Care:
- Eat iron-rich foods (e.g., beans, fortified cereals, meats).
- Avoid skipping meals.
- Drink water and electrolyte-rich fluids.
- Rise slowly from bed or a seated position.

Disclaimer: If dizziness worsens, includes fainting, or continues after your period, seek medical advice."
How can I reduce period cramps naturally?,Menstrual Symptoms,"Period cramps (dysmenorrhea) are caused by uterine contractions triggered by prostaglandins. Higher levels of these chemicals often mean more intense pain.

Home Remedies/Self-Care:
- Heat therapy: Use a hot water bottle or heating pad on the lower abdomen.
- Exercise: Gentle workouts like walking or yoga help release endorphins.
- Herbal teas: Ginger, chamomile, or cinnamon tea may reduce inflammation.
- Diet: Eat anti-inflammatory foods (leafy greens, berries, salmon). Avoid caffeine and salty foods.

Disclaimer: If natural remedies don't help or cramps are severe enough to disrupt daily activities, consult a gynecologist."
Why does my period smell different?,Menstrual Health,"A slight odor during your period is normal and often due to menstrual blood mixing with vaginal bacteria. A strong or foul odor may signal an infection like bacterial vaginosis.

Home Remedies/Self-Care:
- Wash the vulva with warm water (avoid scented soaps inside the vagina).
- Change pads/tampons regularly (every 4–6 hours).
- Wear breathable cotton underwear.
- Stay hydrated to flush out toxins.

Disclaimer: If there's a fishy, sour, or foul smell with itching or unusual discharge, seek medical attention for possible infection."
Why do I feel depressed before my period?,PMS,"Mood changes before your period are usually due to PMS or PMDD (Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder) — conditions caused by fluctuations in estrogen and progesterone affecting serotonin levels.

Home Remedies/Self-Care:

- Increase fiber intake to promote estrogen excretion

Disclaimer: Diagnosis requires hormone testing. Speak with a healthcare provider for confirmation and treatment options."
How does PCOS affect fertility?,Hormonal Health,"PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) disrupts ovulation due to hormone imbalances—mainly elevated androgens and insulin resistance. This makes it harder to conceive naturally.

Home Remedies/Self-Care:
- Balanced diet with low sugar/refined carbs
- Exercise regularly to improve insulin sensitivity
- Maintain healthy weight to restore ovulation
- Supplements like inositol may support ovarian function

Disclaimer: PCOS varies by person. Talk to a reproductive endocrinologist if you're trying to conceive."
